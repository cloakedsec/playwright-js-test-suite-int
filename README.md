# ðŸ©º Web Health Inspector â€“ Playwright-Powered Portfolio Project

Welcome to **Web Health Inspector**, a developer-focused site auditing tool built using **Playwright + TypeScript**. This tool tests the health of any publicly accessible website by scanning for:

- âœ… SEO metadata
- ðŸ”— Broken links
- â™¿ Accessibility issues (WCAG AA)
- âš¡ Performance bottlenecks
- ðŸ“„ A downloadable audit report (HTML-based)

This project is part of my personal portfolio and demonstrates my ability to design and build a full-stack automation utility using modern test frameworks and developer tooling.
